# Brute Force Latin (Flask Version)

This web application is an alternative version of the Brute Force Latin site using Flask/Python instead of NodeJS/React.

The [original Brute Force Latin project](https://github.com/Brute-Force-Programmers/brute-force-latin) was started by [@g-strick](https://github.com/g-strick) and contributed to
by [rpupo7322](https://github.com/rpupo7322) and [myself](https://github.com/cmadajski).

I wanted to see if I could implement similar features in a different framework than the original project.
